# Crowdfunding API
- A pretend crowdfunding api with some trading rules, where you can create a account, open crowdfundings and receive deposits.

- This project was made mainly to learn about Docker/Postgres and improve my coding and solving problems skills.

## Setup

### Install dependencies

```bash
npm i
```

### Run Docker

The application and the database runs essentially in Docker containers, so you may have it installed to run this project.

The command below will build and up the docker image.

```bash
npm run compose
```

## Usage

- After building and running the containers, you'll be able to access [the documentation](http://localhost:9000/docs):
