# API Template
A template with some good packages to develop, run, build and test your API (using [Fastify](https://fastify.dev), in this case)

The TypeScript compilation and test packages was inspired by [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxiRCcnsKDw&t=236s).

The eslint plugin is a preference of mine, by this you can just install/setup your own esling config

Remembering this template is for personal use, but is open to advices and tips :D

## Setup
- On the **top-right** corner of this repository page, you should see the **"Use this template"** dropdown, just open and click the **"Create a new repository"** option;
- After setting up your repository and openning in your codespace, install the dependencies:
```console
npm install
```
- Init your project:
  
```console
npm start dev
```

- And you could see the server starting in the your terminal in watch mode:
